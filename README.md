# Ok, so hear me out...
I got bored and doomscrolled through Modrinth's (*at time of creation*) 132 pages of 1.20.1 compatible mods. I picked out a few (146...) mods with the idea of making a "Vanilla on steroids"-like experience with this pack.



**Please Note:**

**I have not fully tested all the mod's compatibility with each other, I honestly just clicked Launch and waited for a mod to crash upon load, when the mod threw an error, I tossed it and tried again. That's it, nothing more has been done...YET!**

##### *So with that said, I do apologize in advanced if anything goes wonky.*

### What VE specifically does/adds
VE is meant to be Vanilla MC-esque, with curated QoL changes, tweaks, and additions to give a nice, refreshing take on the basics, plus a few additional challenges just in case you want a little bit of adventuring.


### Why should you download VE?
In case of boredom, download VE!

Why not? You've probably been like me and doomscrolled modpacks everywhere, looking for the next interesting pack to conquer. After some time passed, I wanted to go back to basics, but it just wasn't cutting it.

Enter Vanilla Exploded!

- You like building, of course, but what about detailed building? We got some of that!
- You like grizzley bears? ducks? snuffles? Freaking squeeky sheeps?! got those too! (and plushies...)
- Overheard your BFF talking about some sort of Ghast Cow? You can find it here!
- Want to play sims, but with villagers? Get married and have kids? Go take an arrow to the knee and find out!
- Wish you could replace that boring hoe with a cool scythe? Nah, me neither...but you can!
- Love Bioshock? Same, so come get your grappling hook and become spooder-man!
- Wanna leave the world behind and see a massive vacuum with other worlds in it? Ad Astra has you covered!
- Already made a wither farm? Figured you would, so Ultris: Boss Expansion has a few things to make you cry...

It's not like you're doing anything else, just give a try and see for yourself!

### Baked-In Tools

Look, I'm no streamer, but I still like to be able to communicate with my friends and sometimes show them sweet new caves from time to time. So I added a few popular mods to help. You are more than welcome to disable them if you have no use for them:

- Simple Voice Chat (Note: A few other mods need this for a dependency...because reasons? idk)
- Replay Mod

Also...

- WorldEdit
- Litematica

*For the big builders*

### One Last Thing...
Well, two things...

1. OptiFine is currently disabled for this modpack due to some issues with Fabric not playing well with it (at least for me, your results may vary) So just be warned that I attempted to work with OptiFine, but it no like Fabric...me dumb dumb, no worky...

2. The **Immersive Portals** Mod likes to sometimes cause issues when you make portals larger than 8x8, so either take care of your portal sizes, or just disable it. That might help with any miscellaneous issue you may be having.

### Bottom Text
If you made it this far, Thanks. I tried really hard to make this with very little effort, and I hope you enjoy any or all of it! This is a small passion project of mine, so updates and changes might take some time.

BUT...

If people like the idea and want to improve on it, Go for it! Have fun! Enjoy yourself! Play with Friends! Or just wait till I eventually update the pack and be lazy (Like me!) I may just overcome my laziness and maybe make a discord server a build a community...
